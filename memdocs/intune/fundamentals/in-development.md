# In development for Microsoft Intune

To help in your readiness and planning, this article lists Intune UI updates and features that are in development but not yet released. Also:

- If we anticipate that you'll need to take action before a change, we'll publish a complementary post in the Office message center.
- When a feature enters production, whether it's in preview or generally available, the feature description will move from this article to [What's new](whats-new.md).  
- Refer to the [Microsoft 365 roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=2&filters=EMS) for strategic deliverables and timelines.

This article and the [What's new](whats-new.md) article are updated periodically. Check back for more updates.

> [!NOTE]
> This article reflects our current expectations about Intune capabilities in an upcoming release. Dates and individual features might change. This article doesn't describe all features in development. It was last updated on the date shown under the title.

## App management

### Install required apps during pre-provisioning<!-- 12716381   -->  
A new toggle will be available in the Enrollment Status Page (ESP) profile that allows you to select whether you want to attempt to install required applications during pre-provisioning (white glove) technician phase. We understand that installing as many applications as possible during pre-provisioning is desired to reduce the end user setup time. To help, we've implemented an option to attempt the installation of all the required apps assigned to a device during technician phase. If there's an app install failure, ESP will continue except for the apps specified in ESP profile. To enable this function, you'll need to edit your Enrollment Status Page profile by selecting **Yes** on the new setting entitled **Only fail selected apps in technician phase**. This setting will only appear if you have blocking apps selected. For information about ESP, go to [Set up the Enrollment Status Page](../enrollment/windows-enrollment-status.md).

### Company Portal automatically installed on Android Enterprise dedicated devices<!-- 6423852  -->  
Intune Company Portal will now be automatically installed on all Android Enterprise dedicated devices to ensure the appropriate handling of app protection policies. Users won't be able to see or launch the Company Portal, and there are no requirements for users to interact with it. Admins will notice that the Company Portal is automatically installed on their Android Enterprise dedicated devices, without the ability to uninstall.

### Uninstall Win32 apps in the Company Portal<!-- 5145748 -->  
*The time frame for the release of this update is still being determined.*

Users will be able to uninstall Win32 apps in the Company Portal. If a Win32 app can be uninstalled by the user, the user will be able to select **Uninstall** for the Win32 app in the Company Portal. For more information about Win32 apps, go to [Win32 app management in Microsoft Intune](../apps/apps-win32-app-management.md).

### Global quiet time app policy settings<!-- 15424417 -->  
The global quiet time settings will allow you to create policies to schedule quiet time for your end users, which will automatically mute Microsoft Outlook email and Teams notifications on iOS/iPadOS and Android platforms. These policies can be used to limit end user notifications received after work hours. When this feature is available, you'll be able to find it in [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) by selecting **Apps** > **Quiet Time** > **Policies**.

## Device configuration

### New Google domain allow-list settings for Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile<!-- 14711684 -->

On Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile, you can configure settings that restrict device features and settings.

Currently, there's an **Add and remove accounts** setting that can allow Google accounts be added to the work profile. For this setting, when you select **Allow all accounts types**, you can also configure:

- **Google domain allow-list**:  Restricts users to add only certain Google account domains in the work profile. You can import a list of allowed domains or add them in the admin center using the `contoso.com` format. When left blank, by default, the OS might allow adding all Google domains in the work profile.

For more information on the settings you can configure, go to [Android Enterprise device settings list to allow or restrict features on personally owned devices using Intune](../configuration/device-restrictions-android-enterprise-personal.md).

Applies to:

- Android Enterprise personally owned devices with a work profile

### Support for multi-SIM iOS/iPadOS device inventory<!--17016690 (replaced 16360290 for tracking -->

You'll be able to view the service subscription fields on devices that have multiple SIM cards installed under the per-device Hardware section. The inventory fields that are capable of reporting multiple values to Intune are:

- **ICCID**
- **IMEI**
- **MEID**
- **Phone number**

These fields will default to using labels returned by the device, such as:  *Primary*, *Secondary*, *CTSubscriptionSlotOne*, and *CTSubscriptionSlotTwo*. These returned labels may be displayed in the language of the local device that is reporting its inventory to Intune.

Applies to:  
- **iOS/iPadOS**

<!-- *********************************************** -->

## Device management

### On-demand proactive remediation for a Windows device<!-- 14783338  -->  
A new device action that is in public preview allows you to run a proactive remediation on-demand to a single Windows device. The **Run** remediation device action will allow you to resolve issues without having to wait for a proactive remediation to run on its assigned schedule. You'll also be able to view the status of proactive remediations under **Remediations** in the **Monitor** section of a device.
